# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Joyce Jiang**

Time spent: **60** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://phone-number-memory-game-final.glitch.me/)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

-  [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
-  [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
-  [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
-  [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
-  [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
-  [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
-  [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

-  [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
-  [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
-  [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
-  [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
-  [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
-  [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

-  [x] Added functionality to the game by creating a phone number version, using a CSS glassmorphism design and experimenting with box shadows.
-  [x] Used Javascript to create typing effect, and to showcase the secret pattern after the game is over.
-  [x] Created a modal popup box for instructions that is interactive in opening and closing the popup.
-  [x] Customized start/stop button.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A few challenges I encountered when creating this project were teaching myself basic JavaScript to make the game more interactive and fun. I have basic HTML and CSS experience before creating this submission but had very limited knowledge of specifically JS. However, I wanted to enhance my game with the goal of showing the secret phone number pattern on the screen *after* the user had won the rounds, as I felt as though the user would appreciate seeing the pattern after going through 10 rounds. At first, I was having difficulty creating the specific function; I knew I needed to code a function of showing the number, and then call that function after the user won the game. I used the example given in the CodePath tutorial of showing and hiding the start and stop buttons for this challenge. I also faced some trouble with JS in creating a popup modal box for when the user first enters the webpage, as well as the option to close the popup using an Apple-inspired popup tab. I overcame these challenges with JS by comparing the knowledge I had of other programming languages of algorithmic thinking with JS, as well as reading tutorials and resources online. I learned JS from this experience of creating this fun, visually pleasing, and interactive game. After creating the first version of the game, I felt unsatisfied and wanted to enhance the game to my liking. I got inspired by a phone dialing game, and originally planned to simply code an img src HTML line to add an image of a phone on the web page, and put the individual buttons overlaid on top. However, I ran into difficulties with formatting the buttons correctly on top of the image and decided it was best suited to create a CSS design representing a phone, playing around with the design as well to accomplish a neomorphism look.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

After completing this submission, I believe that I can definitely improve my CSS design skills as well as increase my Javascript skills. For CSS specifically, I still have some questions about overcoming formatting issues with position and display. Since I have experience with user interface/user experience design, I would love to continue learning about how to implement my designs using HTML, CSS, and JS for webpage development. I would also love the opportunity to learn about responsive design on a webpage to make the game accessible and formatted correctly for everyone, and learn about how to reduce the load time of a web application.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I had more time to work on this project, I would want to first make the game currently as it is responsible to all screen sizes. I would change the individual button number tones to be the exact pitch for the number dials on a typical phone, adhering to the “phone number” theme. I would also spend more time creating a story for the game, such as following a character who’s forgotten an important phone number, and exploring how to create toggle buttons on the game’s intensity level. This would include toggle buttons from the easiest level of having a confirm button on the user’s answer, having the buttons display just the tone and getting rid of the color background, and speeding up the game after each round.
